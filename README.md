# Habit Tracker

## Brief
- Users should be able to login
- Users should be able to choose a habit they want to track (e.g water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep) and choose the frequency at which they want to track the habit.
- Users should be able to track a habit and mark it as complete for the day.
- Users should be able to see if they have completed a habit for the day and see if they have a streak of completing their habits.
- Your website should have the following technical functionality:
- Developers should host a database to store the daily information about users locally.

``` cd HabitHub ```

3. Install the dependencies:
``` npm install ```

4. Go into the backend directory:
``` cd backend ```

5. Run the server
``` node server.js ```

5. Seed the test database by navigating to http://localhost:4000/seedTest on your web browser

6. Stop running the server:
``` CTRL + C ```
``` Y ```

7. Test api routes:
``` npm test ```

8. Return to the HabitHub directory:
``` cd.. ```

9. Run the frontend tests:
``` npm test ```

10. Run React app:
``` npm start ```

11. Open new terminal window

12. Go into backend directory:
``` cd HabitHub/backend ```

13. Comment out the following lines in server.js
```
const seedDataTest = require("./test/seedTest.js")
seedDataTest()
```

14. Run backend server:

## Planning

## User stories (MVP)
- As a user, I want to be able to enter a username/password, so I can login
- As a new user, I want to be able to sign up, so I have an account
- As a user, I want be able to add a habit, so it can be tracked
- As a user, I want to toggle the progress of a habit, so my progress is tracked
- As a user, I want to view my streak, so I know how long I have been keeping it up

### User Stories (Extra)
- As a user, I want to know if my login was incorrect, so I re enter my credentials
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a habit, so I can stop a habit
- As a user, I want to be able to choose how I track my habit, so I can tailor it to habit
